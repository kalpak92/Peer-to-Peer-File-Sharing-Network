Implementation:
1. 1st Server starts
2. Peer sends config peer_port download_port -> sever stores peer_port and download_port to HM
3. Peer sends register -> server registers the peer to current active peer_list
4. peer sends List -> server sends the list of chunks(only chunk-ids)
5. peer calculates start and end index based on its id and asks server for the chunks (Request)
6. peer iterates over the indexes of blocks and gets corresponding blocks from server by issuing a Request command.
7. Peer then stores that chunk to its own HM list_block_file
8. Then peer connects to others and gets all the files
